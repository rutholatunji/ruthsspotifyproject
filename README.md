# Sound hopper

Hey there!

### Objective
The objective of this project was to create an app using Spotify's API audio analysis to show the timestamps of different voices. This would allow the user to skip ahead to a section of song that they like.

### Goals
To improve this project I want to use my results to make another code that I can loop into the audio analysis data.

### See it live on Jupyter notebook
