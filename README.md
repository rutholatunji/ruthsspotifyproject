# Sound hopper

Hey there!

### Objective
The objective of this project was to create an app using Spotify's API audio analysis to automate a playlist that will show the timestamps of different voices.

### Goals
To improve this project I want to use my results to make another code that I can loop into the audio analysis data.

### See it live on Jupyter notebook
